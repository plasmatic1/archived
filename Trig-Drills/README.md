# Trig-Drills
A monolithic trig drill program written using python (and tkinter for gui)

## Instructions

1. Run the program

### Additional Things to Note

#### Numbers

The format for entering answers is relatively simple:  just take a look at some examples below:

- `sin(30 deg)` = `1/2` (`1 / 2` works too, spacing does not matter)
- `sin(60 deg)` = `sqrt(3)/2`
- `cos(0 deg)` = `1`
- `cos(180 deg)` = `-1`
- `tan(90 deg)` = `undefined`

#### Changing the Difficulty

The default settings will create a 5 row, 6 column grid and give 120 seconds to you for answering the questions.  If that's too difficult or easy for you, you can always change the settings of the program.  To change them, simply open the file with a text editor and change them as you wish.  You can also change the program behaviour yourself, but it is not advised as it can mess things up.
